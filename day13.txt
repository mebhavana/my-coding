CSS grid layout method is designed for the two-dimensional layout of items on a webpage or application.Grid layouts gives us a method of creating grid structures that are described in CSS and not in HTML.

It helps us to create layouts that can be redefined using media queries and adapt to different contexts.

Grid layouts allows us properly separate the order of elements in the source from their visual presentation.

With each element having an area on the grid,things are not in risk of overlapping due to text size change,more content than expected or small viewports

CSS Grid layouts excels at dividing a page into major regions,or defining the relationship in terms of size,position and layer between parts of control built from HTTML Primitives.

like tables grid layou enables an designer to align elements into columns and rows.

However many more layouts are possible and are easier with CSS Grids rather than tables.
