Styles in CSS can be applied by three types
1)Inline CSS - Which is written within the code elements

2)Internal or Embed CSS - Which is written inside head tag,we write styling code with the help of <style> tag

3)External CSS - Different CSS file is used to apply styles and link with HTML file

Core concepts of CSS:

Selectors: It helps developer to select an element in page to apply style

Selectors will be in internal and external css

Properties - Apply styling to elements using properties

Inline CSS:

Syntax:<h1 style="color:pink";>Welcome</h1>

Here h1 is a element
     style is a attribute
	 = is a assignment operator
	 color is a property
	 : is a separator
	 pink is a value of property
	 ; is a terminator
	 color:pink is a declaration
	 
Drawbacks of Inline CSS:

1)When we need to change something in the styling it is difficult in inline styling to go to every single code and update styling
2)Redundancy in code

Design principles:

Separation of concern: Since HTML,CSS are written combined,there will be lot of confusion and code has to be maintained separately

In real time there are lots of elements in webpage and lots of code redundancy to reduce that and to clear coding

Internal CSS:

Syntax: .style1{
         color:pink;
		 }

Here . is a selector
     style1 is a class value
	 
Apart from selector each rule set(declaration) is marked in curly braces

within each declaration you must use colon to separate property from it's value

within each rule set you must use semicolon to separation each declaration from next one

Different types of selectors:

id selector
class selector
Attribute selector
psuedo-class selector
	 
Drawbacks of Internal CSS:

If we have multiple html files it is difficult to update styling in each file so external css will comes to picture

External CSS:

Syntax:<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css page link">

CSS files should be saved with .css extension

Advantages:
Reusable code
