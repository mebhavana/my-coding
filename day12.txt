Differences between Float,Flex and Grid:

CSS Flex offers a one dimensional layout model powerful alignment and space distribution

CSS Grid lets you quickly create flexible and two dimensional layouts

Both can be used to place,size,align and develop the website designs

Fundamentals:

CSS Grid layout offers a two dimensional grid based layout system,with rows and columns.It makes designing webpage easier,without having to use floats and positioning

CSS Flex box offers a one dimensional layout.It is helpful in allocating and aligning the space among items in a container

One dimension vs two dimension:

Grid is made for two dimensional layout whereas Flex is made for one.Flex box can work on either row or columns at atime,but grids can work on both.
when working on either element i.e., row or column),we are most associated with the content.

Flexbox gives more flexibility 
HTML Markup and CSS will be easy to manage in this scenario

when working with the webpage layouts ,CSS Grid does the job and it gives more flexibility to move around the blocks

CSS Float is easy to float boxes of content side by side

CSS Float properties:

box-sizing:Defines how the width and height of an element are calculated,should they include padding nad borders or not

clear:specifies what should happen to a element next to a floating element

float:Specifies whether the element should float to the left right or not

overflow:Specifies what happen if conent overflows an element box

overflow-x:specifies what to do with the left/right edges of the content if it overflows the elements content area

overflow-y:specifies what to do with the top/bottom edges of the content if it overflows the element content area

CSS Flex properties:

flex-grow: A number specifing how much the item will grow relative to the rest of flexible items

flex-shrink: A number specifing how much the item will shrink relative to the rest of flexible items

flex-basis: The length of the item

flex-inherit:inherit the property from the parent element

flex-direction:Flex direction property specifies the direction of flexible items

flex-wrap:Flex wrap property specifies whether the flexible item should wrap or not

align-item:align item property specifies the default alignment for items inside the flex-basis

justify-content:Justify content property aligns the flexible container items when the items do not use all the available spaces horizontally

CSS Grid:

Grid layout is a two dimensional grid layout with rows and columns make it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning

like tables grids allows us to align elements into columns and rows

Flex-box:

Flex offers a one dimensional layout. it is helpful in allocating and aligning the space among items in a container
